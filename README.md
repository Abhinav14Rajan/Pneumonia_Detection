# Pneumonia_Detection
A machine learning project that classifies chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia. Utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, trained on labeled medical datasets. Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and pneumonia-affected lungs, supporting faster and more accurate diagnosis.
